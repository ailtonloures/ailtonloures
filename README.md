Currently, I am taking a post-graduation course in Software Engineering and I have over 4 years of experience in Software Development. I'm always looking to take on a new challenge and I'm passionate about technology.

I have experience working with several technologies and programming languages. Today, I am a Fullstack Software Developer and I'm also providing services for Fiocruz (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) in institutional projects and projects management on Gitlab/Github. 

On top of this, I have an innovative instinct and I'm always looking forward to learning new things!
